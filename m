Right.

I was under the impression that lklfuse uses UML.  Given the weird
things in arch/lkl/Kconfig:

config 64BIT
	bool "64bit kernel"
	default y if OUTPUT_FORMAT = "pe-x86-64"
	default $(success,$(srctree)/arch/lkl/scripts/cc-objdump-file-format.sh|grep -q '^elf64-') if OUTPUT_FORMAT != "pe-x86-64"

I was kinda guessing x86_64 was the primary target of the developers?

/me notes that he's now looked into libguestfs per Demi Marie's comments
and some curiosity on the part of ngompa and i>

Whatever it is that libguestfs does to stand up unprivileged fs mounts
also could fit this bill.  It's *really* slow to start because it takes
the booted kernel, creates a largeish initramfs, boots that combo via
libvirt, and then fires up a fuse server to talk to the vm kernel.

I think all you'd have to do is change libguestfs to start the VM and
run the fuse server inside a systemd container instead of directly from
the CLI.

Not a hard requirement, just a means to convince people that they can
choose containment without completely collapsing performance.

That covers nearly all of it.

Or even a good non-iomap fuse server for every filesystem.  Admittedly
the weak part of fuse4fs is that libext2fs is not as robust as the
kernel is.

Yeah.

Probably a lot, because now you have to run a full IO stack all the way
through lklfuse.

Correct.

btrfs cow can be done with iomap, at least on the directio end.  It's
the other features like fsverity/fscrypt/data checksumming that aren't
currently supported by iomap.
