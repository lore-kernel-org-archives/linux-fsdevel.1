It's sort of a combination -- read the data structures :)  Other than
the propagation part, they're really not that bad.

In any event, I think this discussion is sort of immaterial to the
proposed API change.  No one is about to remove the concept of a mount
namespace.  But maybe it makes sense to have a way to have a task that
doesn't actually belong to a mount namespace.  A mount namespace is
certainly going to exist.

There will definitely be subtleties.  For example, what happens if a
task with "no mount namespace" tries to do OPEN_TREE_CLONE?  In some
logical sense it ought to work but it ought to be impossible to
actually mount the resulting tree anywhere, but this risks running
afoul of all kinds of checks.  Maybe you get a whole new mount
namespace (that does not become your current mnt_ns) if you
OPEN_TREE_CLONE?

This stuff is complex and it probably makes more sense to keep changes simp=
le.
