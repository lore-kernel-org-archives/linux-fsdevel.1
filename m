First, I had to figure out exactly what FIEMAP_EXTENT_UNKNOWN is and what i=
t=E2=80=99s intended for. As I understand it, I share the view that the inf=
ormation should always be the same. We=E2=80=99re operating on different le=
vels here, depending on where the information is located. For Sync Services=
, however, it makes sense not to read the explicit blocks every time. It wo=
uld be a clean architectural abstraction.

Cheers, Lukas

FYI, there is already `FIEMAP_EXTENT_UNKNOWN` which indicates the same info=
rmation,
namely that the file data is inaccessible and cannot be mapped to blocks.

Having a statx() flag pass on the same information seems useful, since it s=
hould be
much lighter weight than calling fiemap to get a single bit of information.=
  However,
it makes sense that if `STATX_ATTR_OFFLINE` is returned for a file then fie=
map
should also consistently return `FIEMAP_EXTENT_UNKNOWN` for that file.
