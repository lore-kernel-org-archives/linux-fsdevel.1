Hi, Yi,

Thanks. Yes, for existing metadata blocks ext4 is read-modify-write, so=20
without a successful read (Uptodate) there is no write path to update=20
that block.

In the case we're seeing, the read keeps failing (repeated I/O errors on=20
the same LBA), so the write never has a chance to run either. Given=20
that, would it make sense (as Fengnan suggested) to treat persistent=20
media errors (e.g. MEDIUM ERROR / IO ERROR) as non-retryable at the=20
filesystem level, i.e. keep failing fast for that block? That would=20
avoid the BH_Lock thundering herd and prevent hung tasks.

Thanks,
Diangang
