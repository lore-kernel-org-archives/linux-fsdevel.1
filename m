The coredump socket approach is easier to implement because it allows for
interaction between the server and client, enabling the customization of
protocols. However, for the coredump file method, I can only think of
defining "r" and "R" through core_pattern to release flock and file-backed
shared data in advance. I'm unsure if this is feasible, as it changes the
original definition of core_pattern.

Regarding the coredump pipe, there is also a lack of a mechanism for the
pipe program to notify the coredump process, so it might still require
adding "r" and "R" at the end of core_pattern to indicate this, allowing
the coredump process to handle the early release on its own. I'm not sure
if my understanding is correct.

Even if the coredump pipe program obtains the file pointer from the process
that generated the coredump, it cannot reduce the reference count of the
file (which I understand is a very bad attempt). Since it cannot decrease
the reference count of the file, the early release must still be performed
by the task that generated the coredump. Given this situation, it seems
that we indeed need to use core_pattern for marking. I've thought for a
long time about more suitable solutions, but I haven't come up with any.

OK, if I use it at last, I will not put it in user header file.

I'll get rid of the attempt to add a new boot-up argument for this feature.

When executing this traversal logic, we have already acquired a lock, and
the process has been frozen. The traversal logic goes from start to finish.
Are you sure that this approach could still have issues?

Since the process has already been frozen, shouldn't we not need to consider
such concurrency issues?

Currently, this flag will only be used by the logic we added, so I believe
there won't be any issues.
