This reminded me of something so I looked it up.
Then I re-read your sample code.

And I think you have asked the wrong question.

The question should be why does fsopen test may_mount?  As it doesn't
mount the filesystem at that point.

Your example code could just do:

int cmd_temp_shm(int argc, char **) {
    if (argc !=3D 1) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Usage: lktool temp_shm\n");
        return 1;
    }

    try {
        OwnedFd context{static_cast<int>(syscall(SYS_fsopen, "tmpfs",
FSOPEN_CLOEXEC))};
        Check(context.fd, "fsopen tmpfs");
        Check(syscall(SYS_fsconfig, context.fd, FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE,
nullptr, nullptr, 0),
              "fsconfig create tmpfs");

        OwnedFd mount{static_cast<int>(syscall(SYS_fsmount,
context.fd, FSMOUNT_CLOEXEC, 0))};
        Check(mount.fd, "fsmount tmpfs");
        Check(fchdir(mount.fd), "fchdir tmpfs");

        // The detached mount is kept alive by cwd and the mount descriptor.
        // No mount is attached to the inherited filesystem hierarchy.
        std::string path =3D "/proc/" + std::to_string(getpid()) + "/cwd";
        path.push_back('\0');
        WriteAll(STDOUT_FILENO, path);
        for (;;)
            pause();
    } catch (const std::system_error &e) {
        fprintf(stderr, "lktool temp_shm: %s\n", e.what());
        return 1;
    }
}


It would not surprise me if in practice there are assumptions that have
to be worked through to allow that to work, but it seems a perfectly
reasonable thing to do on first glance.  Especially since there are
useful application of doing that.

The really interesting piece to make it through is FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE.
I think that permission check and the logic there are what needs to
be modified to make it work without a user namespace.

There is also fsopen which has that has a may_mount check that seems
to serve not immediately discernible purpose.

The part that can obviously break pre-existing privileged applications
is the mount_move that attaches the mount to an existing mount
namespace, and that is obviously not allowed.  That definitely can not
be allowed.

The unprivileged mounter without a usernamespace at that point won't
have the ability to reconfigure the filesystem.  So the attack vectors
I was worried about earlier don't seem to apply.

There is a practical question is the additional attack surface and
maintenance burden worth it.

At a quick look it seems reasonable for a handful of filesystems like
tmpfs to allow mounting without first creating a user namespace.

There might even be an argument in there somewhere for allowing
privilege separation of the mount command.

In summary.  At first glance it seems reasonable to allow fsopen,
FSCONFIG_CMD_CREATE, fsmount on select filesystems without privilege and
without a user namespace.
