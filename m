Subject: [PATCH v5] coredump: Add bit 9 of coredump_filter for pre-exit files before dumping

A coredump typically takes seconds or even longer to complete. If we
happen to hold a write lock with flock just before triggering the
coredump, that write lock will not be released during the entire coredump
process. As a result, other processes attempting to acquire the same write
lock may experience significant delays. Another typical scenario is that
some custom management modules for shared memory also need to release the
reference counts of the related buffers as soon as possible, rather than
waiting until the coredump is complete.

Add a new bit(9) of coredump_filter to tag whether need to dump fd list.
We set it by default because tools like systemd-coredump go through the
fds. Some other coredump pipe programs like minicoredump do not use fds by
default. If you are sure that your coredump backend does not use the fds,
you can clear bit 9, which will allow some file resources without VMA
references to be released earlier.

In fput(), check FP_DUMPCORE task flags to NOT release file by task work,
otherwise file put operation will NOT execute util coredump finish.

Test Case One - flock
Test program send signal SIGABRT to the program which owns the flock,
output the wait time(unit ms) to successfully attach the flock.
Test program malloc 500MB heap and memset it.
If NOT set bit9 of coredump_filter, waitms is 11280.
If set bit9 of coredump_filter, waitms is 0.

Test Case Two - ion buffer
Test programs include ion buffer publisher and ion buffer subscriber.
Ion buffer publisher output the ion buffer hold_time if the subscriber
NOT send ack to publisher and NOT release it. The subscriber will trig
coredump by itself in some time.
If NOT set bit9 of subscriber coredump_filter, max hold_time is 19591ms.
If set bit9 of subscriber coredump_filter, max hold_time is 320ms.

Change in v5:
- Not add another bootargs for the feature,
  as suggested by Christian Brauner and Lorenzo Stoakes.
  Add bit9 of coredump_filter to tag whether need to dump fd list.
  Set bit9 to 1 as default.
- Al Viro, Christian Brauner and Lorenzo Stoakes point out so many
  problems of the code related to umap that was added in v4, delete all of
  it which is unnecessary. The management of reference counting for shared
  memory generally does not need to be released through the release
  operation of files that have VMA references. Traversing all the threads
  within the process and executing exit_files() is sufficient.
- Fulfill comments and commit log,
  as suggested by Pedro Falcato and Lorenzo Stoakes.

Change in v4:
- Christian pointed out that the coredump process will traverse file
  descriptors (fd), so certain fds should not be closed by default.
  Rework the whole feature, add /proc/<pid>/coredump_pre_exit for user
  pre-exit resources selection, default is NOT pre-exit anything.
- Mateusz suggested that walking the fd table and release the file-lock is
  reasonable. No longer release all the fd(s). Based on user config, only
  the flock fd(s) and the fd(s) correspondent to file-backed shared memory
  will be released at most.
- Link to v4: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260624145552.70143-1-jackzxcui1989@163.com/

Change in v3:
- Add comment and commit-log to explain why do the MMF_DUMP_MAPPED_SHARED
  mm_flags_test() check, note that memory mapped files keep their own
  separate references to the files. The case to work around is that early
  unlocking a flock on a file allows other processes to lock and modify
  the mapped data protected by the flock,
  as suggested by Pedro Falcato.
- Link to v3: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260619122419.3954581-1-jackzxcui1989@163.com/

Change in v2:
- Get rid of the implement of adding new fcntl API, the issue does not
  worth inflicting the cost on everyone,
  as suggested by Al Viro.
- Call exit_files() in coredump_wait(),
  as suggested by Eric W. Biederman.
  Add MMF_DUMP_MAPPED_SHARED mm_flags_test() check to filter cases that
  need to dump file-backed shared memory.

 The default value of coredump_filter is 0x33; this means all anonymous memory
 segments, ELF header pages and hugetlb private memory are dumped.

-write 0x31 to the process's proc file::

 When a new process is created, the process inherits the bitmask status from its
 parent. It is useful to set up coredump_filter before the program runs.
