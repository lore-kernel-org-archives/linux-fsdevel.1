File system would need special handling for BLK_STS_AGAIN were we to wire
it up again (in upstream we have the dead direct-io code removed in
patch 1, and an incorrect use in iomap polled I/O I sent a separate patch
for), because simply bubbling it up as -EAGAIN will generally do the
wrong thing.  We ran into file system corruption last time we did it due
to non-idempotency of writes and general locking issues with just
retrying at a higher level.

Thus the rough consensus was that If we want to support fs-issued
REQ_NOWAIT I/O we'd first need to add infrastructure to retry them from
a blocking context at the bio-level, preferably in the block layer
itself.
