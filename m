That uses less space in the struct, so yes.

fa_xflags already provides that coverage for the other fields in struct
file_attr, e.g. a getattr caller can ignore fa_extsize if
FS_XFLAG_EXTSIZE isn't set; and setattr will (iirc) reject nonzero
fa_extsize if FS_XFLAG_EXTSIZE isn't set.

Pali Rohar's work would make it possible to discover which fa_xflags
fields are settable or clearable for a given file.

FICLONE is currently treated like a write, which means that mtime is
updated on the destination file.  For filesystems supporting ptime you'd
probably want the kernel to copy the ptime from src to dest after the
remapping completes.

(Same for exchange-range)

Got it.
