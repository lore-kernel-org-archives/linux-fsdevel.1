Yes, I know about the behavior that iomap_writepages() can cache extent
longer than what folio_lock covers. But after truncate_inode_pages_range()
completes in the truncate path, writeback_iter will never attempt to map
anything for folios beyond i_size. If we had anything cached from before
truncate, iomap_valid() check takes care it isn't used.

But I think you might be concerned about the following race:
In the writeback path iomap_writeback_folio() is called for folio 0.
iomap_writeback_handle_eof() still sees old i_size so end_pos is kept
large, we go down to ext4_map_blocks() which runs ext4_map_query_blocks()
and still sees larger delalloc extent. Then truncate to folio 1 comes. It
can fully run and complete because folio 0 is not affected by it. Then
ext4_map_blocks() resumes and calls ext4_map_create_blocks() with the (now
stale) long delalloc extent and allocates blocks under already truncated
area.

Frankly what I think needs to happen is to fix ext4_map_blocks() so that
after reacquiring i_data_sem, we recheck m_seq still matches i_seq and if
not, redo the extent status tree lookup which will as a side effect also
trim the length to map to appropriate size. What do you think?

Right yes. I remembered wrong what we ended up with. But I was certain
the usecase of offloading from ->bi_end_io is handled. :)

Exactly.

Hmm, yes, something like that. Basically iomap ioend processing will need
to be updated to play well with the generic IO completion offloading
infrastructure. But that's a separate topic. Just keep things simple
(possibly not perfect in terms of performance) since we should transition
to the generic infrastructure sooner rather than later.
