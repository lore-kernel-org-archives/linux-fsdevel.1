Ugh.

You're at least functionally correct, although this all reminds me
that I have never felt like Linux's vfs mount hierarchy makes any
sense:

root@debian:/mnt/empty# mkdir hidden
root@debian:/mnt/empty# mount --bind /usr .
root@debian:/mnt/empty# ls
hidden
root@debian:/mnt/empty# ls hidden/..
bin  games  include  lib  libexec  local  sbin share  src
