I can't tell the exact size tho, roughly it's between 1GB and 4GB. And,
per lots of test results with various tunings, it turned out memory
allocation speed was the culprit. If we use 4KB page, we couldn't get
the full bandwidth unless we set the biggest core running the highest frequency.
Unfortunately, however, we can't use the core like that due to performance
drop of other system service and power drain.

Agreed it's hard to get this done perfectly tho, as the best effort on this
particular AI model case, I focused on two timings when loading the models:
1) right after device boot, 2) dynamic loading when required. To secure high
order pages, for 1), I disabled the large folio consumed by EROFS, while for
2), I tried to call compact_memory before loading the model. Both of cases,
I could observe we could get fair amount of large folios. Yes, not 100% tho.

I think that's doable, yes, if the explict hint is acceptable.

Indeed, I was off from LSF/MM for years due to various product issues, not
related F2FS tho. Let me make some effort to attend upcoming ones like LPC,
if I can get the budget from company.
