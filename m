I agree that hidepid=3D4 is arguably yet another procfs subset (in fact I
was thinking of giving it as an example in my earlier mail) and arguably
should have somewhat similar restrictions. hidepid=3D1 and hidepid=3D2 are
not as extreme IMHO (since most /proc/$pid/* accesses are gated behind
ptrace_may_access() anyway).

One potential model here would be to have an opaque bitmask of
restrictions and only more-or-equally restricted superblocks can count
towards mnt_already_visible(). But again, I think we can add this once
we need it.

Sounds good.
