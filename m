I mean... I thought that's the intent to binfmt_misc, to have multiple
handlers -- with the expressiveness of eBPF vs. the limited
magic/extension, it seems like a natural extension to support multiple.
Otherwise anyone on NixOS would be limited to our single handler for all
binaries which seems not ideal?

I'm not knowledgeable enough to comment on the sleep/faulting aspect so
I leave that to your expertise.

What is "cool" about this is now it's also a net-new feature for shebags
which the "old" binfmt_misc didn't support. Anyways, I was thining ahead
about what I would need to support $ORIGIN fully and this was
a remaining gap. We also explored this idea in a patch pre-BPF [1] but
now that we've settled on this solution it seems much more natural.


I was recently reached out by some Bazel people who are also interested
in this $ORIGIN support. Interestingly they let me know that
IllumOS/Solaris had support for it as well.
