Hi everyone,

This is the eighth public draft of a prototype to connect the Linux
fuse driver to fs-iomap for regular file IO operations to and from files
whose contents persist to locally attached storage devices.  With this
release, I show that it's possible to build a fuse server for a real
filesystem (ext4) that runs entirely in userspace yet maintains most of
its performance.

This effort is now separate from the one to run fuse servers in a
constrained environment via systemd.  Putting fuse servers in a
container gets you all the blast radii reduction advantages and provides
a pathway to removing less popular filesystem drivers to reduce
maintenance work in the kernel; now we want trade relaxation of that
isolation for better performance.

The fuse command plumbing is very simple -- the ->iomap_begin,
->iomap_end, and iomap ->ioend calls within iomap are turned into
upcalls to the fuse server via a trio of new fuse commands.  Pagecache
writeback is now a directio write.  The fuse server can upsert mappings
into the kernel for cached access (== zero upcalls for rereads and pure
overwrites!) and the iomap cache revalidation code works.

At this stage I still get about 95% of the kernel ext4 driver's
streaming directio performance on streaming IO, and 110% of its
streaming buffered IO performance.  Random buffered IO is about 85% as
fast as the kernel.  Random direct IO is about 80% as fast as the
kernel; see the cover letter for the fuse2fs iomap changes for more
details.  Unwritten extent conversions on random direct writes are
especially painful for fuse+iomap (~90% more overhead) due to upcall
overhead.  And that's with (now dynamic) debugging turned on!

This series has been rebased to 7.1-rc1 since the seventh RFC, but it
has not otherwise changed much.  Most changes happened in userspace:

1. I've written some example fuse-iomap servers, so I now have a vehicle
   for testing that out of place writes works (they do) and that inline
   data works.

2. Ted has started merging the very large quantity of fuse2fs
   improvements into e2fsprogs.

3. I reordered the systemd service container patchset towards master
   because the maintainer indicated that he wanted to merge it.

There are some questions remaining:

a. I would like to continue the discussion about how the design review
   of this code should be structured, and how might I go about creating
   new userspace filesystem servers -- lightweight new ones based off
   the existing userspace tools?  Or by merging lklfuse?

b. fuse2fs doesn't support the ext4 journal.  Urk.

c. I've dropped the fstests and BPF parts of the patchbomb because v7
   was just way too long.  I'm also not including some extra
   enhancements to fuse4fs, also for brevity.

I would like to get the main parts of this submission reviewed for 7.2
now that this has been collecting comments and tweaks in non-rfc status
for 5.5 months.
