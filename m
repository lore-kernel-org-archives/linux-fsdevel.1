Hi Hannes,

Can you talk through your use model a little bit more?
I'm guessing this is about untagged DCD being used in a virtio-mem
like way?  Hence you want to clear out a range of DPA base so you can
do a partial release?

I may have completely missed what you are targetting though so an
example would be great.

Superficially feels a bit arcane, particularly as we are currently
kicking untagged memory into the long grass as there are too many
open questions on how to present it at all (e.g. related to Gregory's
recent work on private nodes).  On recent CXL sync calls the proposal
has been to do tagged memory first and only support allocation of
all memory with a given tag in one go and full release.

Anyhow, sounds like the sort of thing I'm always keen to discuss
but I'm not going to be at LSFMM this year.

Jonathan
