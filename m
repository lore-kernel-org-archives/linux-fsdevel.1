As I tried to explain in my previous e-mail this approach does not cut
it because of NUMA.

Suppose you have a machine with 2 nodes. The parent-to-be is running
on node 0 and the child is intended to exec something on node 1.

When the parent-to-be allocates and populates stuff, it takes place with
memory backed by node 0. If you allocate task_struct, the file table and
other frequently used (and modified!) objs in this way, you are
guaranteeing performance loss due to interconnect traffic to access it.

Trying to add plumbing so that all allocations respect numa placement is
probably too cumbersome.

The primary example for that is looking up the binary to exec in the
first place.

userspace likes to pass paths which don't exist, meaning checking for
the binary before any hard work is a useful optimizaiton. Suppose the
binary to be executed is in a container bound with a taskset using
node 1 and the content of the fs part of the container is currently
fully uncached.

When you perform the lookup on node 0, you are populating a bunch of
metadata (inode, dentry) using memory from that domain. But the intended
user will only execute on node 1, again resulting in a performance loss.

In order to not do it you would need to convince VFS to allocate memory
elsewhere.

So I stand by my previous claim that ultimately a pristine child has to
be created (like in this patch), but which also has to do the work on
its own.

Suppose there is no explicit placement requested anywhere. Even in that
case there are legitimate workloads which will eventually be forced to
exec stuff on another node. Even these have a better chance retaining
full locality if the child process does all the work.

Per my previous message I don't see a clean interface to do it.
something quasi-posix_spawn is probably the least bad way out, it will
also allow userspace to easily wrap the new thing with posix_spawn
itself.

Also note there is another issue with the fd-based approach: the fd will
get inherited on fork and will hang out in the child afterwards unless
explicitly closed. Suppose you have a multithreaded program which likes
to both fork(+no exec) and fork+exec. With the fd-based approach you
have no means of stopping another thread from grabbing your state thanks
to unix defaulting to copying everything. There was an attempt to fix
this aspect with O_CLOFORK, but this got rejected.

Whatever exactly happens, NUMA is a sad fact of computing and needs to
be accounted for. The approach as proposed not only does not do it, but
it actively hinders such deployments.
