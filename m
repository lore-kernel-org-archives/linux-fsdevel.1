Thanks for the detailed explanation.

I checked my environment again though -- it turned out not to be
xfstests-bld at all.  xfstests-bld never touches e2fsprogs.

What happened is that I had manually run "make install" of a locally
patched e2fsprogs in the test VM, which overwrote util-linux's blkid
and fsck.

Rebuilding e2fsprogs with these options disabled made the test pass:

    ./configure --disable-libblkid --disable-fsck \
            --disable-libuuid --disable-uuidd

I ran unpatched generic/492 60 times on each side in a VM: 12/60
failures with the hand-installed strays, 0/60 with util-linux's
blkid/fsck.

That said, I think the patch is still needed, because
FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL does not update the block device's mtime:

    blkid -s LABEL ...    # get A
    FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL     # set B (device mtime unchanged)
    blkid -s LABEL ...    # still get A (within 2s)

The first read writes a cache entry with TIME=now, and the ioctl
leaves the device mtime untouched, so a second read within the 2s
window still trusts the cache.

I reproduced this with util-linux 2.41.5 too, so
"blkid -c /dev/null" is what keeps the test deterministic
regardless of which blkid the image carries.


Cheers,
Baokun
