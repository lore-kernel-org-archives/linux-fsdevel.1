There goes my dream if an rstat-free world :')

I am very surprised though that you care about hierarchies this deep.
I don't think we have anything close to even 8 at Google, and in all
my previous testing I usually test up to 4 or 5 levels. I suspect at
that level the difference might be acceptable. But aren't other
operations also really expensive at that depth? I imagine the charging
path is really slow if it has to do atomic updates for 32 parents. Is
the update path really a problem given everything else?

Given the constant cost of rstat updates, it also seems like
memcg_vmstats_needs_flush() is mostly evaluating to true and skipping
the parent walk. I wonder how much this remains true in practice, I
think Shakeel mentioned that it does help in production.

I think that's only part of the story. rstat iterates all children
cgroups as well. I think reading multiple contiguous stats may
actually be really cheap since they are likely in the same cacheline.

Hmm interesting analysis, but I actually think a more interesting one
is the effect of the update latency in respective update paths. For
example, in the zswap_store() case you analyzed earlier, it ends up
being in the noise. I would check what the hottest update paths are
(probably networking?) and check what the update paths are, to check
if they are really sensitive to the increased update cost. It could be
the case that at least stats that are used by in-kernel flushers do
not really care about the extra update cost.

Yup, this is exactly what I mean. This is a good analysis for the cost
of the flush: how much it matters end-to-end. Even though the full
flush is 14x more expensive according to your numbers, it seems like
it ultimately doesn't affect performance much. I would do the same for
the update paths, see if the extra cost really matters. WDYT?

If we can eat the cost of the flush here that's great, but I think we
can't say the same for the vmscan and zswap paths (at least)? :/
