Seems quite reasonable to me.

I think that's fine here and is probably all we need for now (though I
think that the name is a little confusing especially given my next
comment), but I think there is a bit of a deeper problem here that
deserves to be mentioned if only for posterity.

The core issue really is that we actually have two versions of procfs
now, and they are effectively distinguished by fs_context flags instead
of fs_type. Back when subset=3Dpid was merged there was a discussion about
a hypothetical proc2 -- while that got dropped, we are kind of
reinventing this split in an ad-hoc way.

Conceptually considering them as two distinct fs_types would be the more
semantically correct thing to do, though I think it would be overkill to
come up with some framework for that. (I also really hope we don't have
any other filesystems where this is also the case.)

This is why I think the name is a little weird, since it isn't an issue
about one procfs being restricted in a userns, it's that they are
conceptually unrelated filesystem types. A very lightweight version of
this would be making it something like SB_I_RESTRICTED_VARIANT that
would be more a little more strict than what you have now --
SB_I_RESTRICTED_VARIANT would not be treated as compatible with anything
(even another SB_I_RESTRICTED_VARIANT mount) so that if we add more
variants in the future we don't treat them the same either. (Again, I
don't think we need this now?) Of course this would still allow
subset=3Dpid without a procfs mount because of the other special casing
for it in mount_too_revealing().

We are also limited in what semantics we can change here too (and I'm a
little worried that even this bit for SB_I_USERNS_RESTRICTED is at risk
of breaking something) so maybe that isn't needed today.
