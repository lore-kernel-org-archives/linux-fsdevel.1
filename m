It does not.  Posix very precisely uses "directory entry" when referring
to directory entries, and files refer to what is an inode in Linux.
This is very clear in the rename documentation:

    The rename() function shall change the name of a file. The old
    argument points to the pathname of the file to be renamed. The new
    argument points to the new pathname of the file.
    If the new argument does not resolve to an existing directory
    entry...

The directory entry for the old file is removed, and the directory entry
for the file is added in one atomic transaction.

I'm in agreement here.
