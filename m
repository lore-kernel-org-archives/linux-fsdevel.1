Apparently there's some misunderstanding about this situation here, sigh.

So for avoidance of doubt - I've now spent many hours on this, and unfortunately
(as I've already said in multiple places) this series has serious architectural
and code flaws.

And unfortunately, the anon_vma approach is not something we wish to extend, for
reasons I've gone into elsewhere - but broadly because it's a broken
abstraction, that uses lots of memory and causes lock contention.

The approach here has multiple technical issues, so many that getting into each
one would require hours more of my time to analyse, maybe all week?

And then if there were further replies and replies to the replies and respins...

However, I also feel there's substantive, overlapping, evidence of the _logic_
(not the text, we are FINE with using AI to assist text for non-native speakers)
being LLM-generated.

However you can never prove this for 100% certain. But you can certainly be more
or less sure. I would never suggest this unless I was really pretty certain.

I am very keen to avoid 'witch hunts', or rash accusations. This is not
that. It's a _carefully considered_ opinion, based on evidence.

But of course - I do not know for SURE. You can never know.

The big problem here is asymmetry of maintainer resource. I simply _cannot_
respond to every single issue here. And when the architecture is something we
don't want, then it's not really necessary to.

And my big deep underlying concern with all this is - people can generate a very
significant amount of this kind of work, and we have limited reviewer time.

I've already dealt with burnout recently that I'm thankfully recovering
from. I'm not really keen to go back to that.

I really truly worry that if we don't have a means by which we can quickly
dismiss/deprioritise things when we have a _significant_ evidence of wholesale
AI generation, then maintainer overload will increase exponentially.

And that's really a serious problem.

If we treat it like simply a technically incorrect solution, then it means we
open it up to further discussion on and onx, as we're actually observing here. If
the responses are also LLM-generated then it's even more problematic.

This is why I bring it up, and proactively say it's lead to a real loss in trust
in this case, and why, after there was a response that included a hallucinated
field in it, I went further and said that I really don't want to have a
discussion either.

It's because of this asymmetry.

And even this reply, written at 9.45pm at night, after several hours of
discussion about this off-list, is evidence of the problem we have with this
kind of asymmetry.

It's nothing personal, it's about managing time and resources.

Thanks, Lorenzo
