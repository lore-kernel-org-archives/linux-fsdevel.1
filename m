IMO, we first need to reach a consensus on whether we can expect a
retry to succeed after a read failure.=C2=A0
Given that current SCSI and NVMe drivers already perform multiple
retries for I/O errors.
IMO, this depends on the specific error. If the block layer returns
BLK_STS_RESOURCE or BLK_STS_AGAIN, we can retry; however, if
it returns BLK_STS_MEDIUM or BLK_STS_IOERR, there is no need to retry.
For scenarios requiring a retry, we should also wait for a certain time
window before retrying.

Thanks.
Fengnan.
