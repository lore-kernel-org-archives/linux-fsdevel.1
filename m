Thanks I appreciate that.

I don't mean to be 'mean' here, I'm only acting in what I feel are the best
interests of mm and the kernel.

Maybe I didn't express it clearly enough at LSF, but this is entirely a key
point of my CoW context design :)

It's true most stuff is leaf, and yes we can take advantage of this, and CoW
context allows us to do it while also unravelling the issues with anon_vma.

I am actually thinking of doing some incremental changes as part of my work
possibly if I can.

I maybe need to expedite that to bring some clarity to things here...

Right, I see. Again I'm really trying to tread a fine line here between the
technical discussion and not pouring more and more time into a discussion that's
not useful to me or the community.

See [0] as to my reasoning on this :)
