Like other bits of coredump_filter, it is actually attached to the mm flags.

Are you saying that the file release operation must be performed in the
context of each task_struct? I'm not quite clear on the necessity of doing
this. The execution of exit_files merely reduces the reference count of
the file_struct for the thread, rather than decreasing the reference count
of each individual file.

The essence of file descriptors (fd) is to allow processes to reference
specific files through an index. The fundamental purpose of exit_files()
is that when a process exits, it no longer needs to reference files by
their indices. From this perspective, I don't see it causing any issues,
because even if functions like exit_sem and exit_shm need to use file
instances, they won't use the fd index; instead, they will increase the
reference count of the file as needed in the prior logic. By the time the
core dump begins execution, user-space logic will no longer be running.
Therefore, as long as the contents of the core dump do not require the
mapping relationship between fd and file, the file can be safely put.

yes

As you mentioned, other processes may potentially reference these files
across processes, so even if a core dump is not triggered, the file
release actions are not entirely executed within task_work. Because after
a process exits, other processes may still hold references to the file,
the work for releasing the file cannot be added to task_work at that
point. In this case, it still uses schedule_delayed_work().

If kernel developers do not correctly implement the file release
operation, such as relying on certain information from the task context to
free related resources, then the issues arising from such unreasonable
release operations will manifest in other scenarios, regardless of my
changes. My modifications only amplify this problem in the context of core
dumps.
