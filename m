I am pretty certain it was deliberate at the time.

Interesting question.  You are in a user namespace.  You are
running as a user that does not exist in your user namespace.
You want to create files.

You can map a that single uid and gid without privileges.
So there is no hardship in getting a uid and gid in your user namespace.

Is it just the extra bit of code to perform that write that is the
problem?

Why would you want to be able to create files as a owned by a user
from another user namespace?  Even if you created them reading them
would show an 0xfffe the invalid uid/gid.  I think there are then
some difficulties in using those files as well.

Why would you want to do much of anything as without having a
properly setup uid or gid?

At a quick look tmpfs just uses vfs inodes which use kuid_t and kgid_t
so it theoretically would be ok.

Still what would be the motivation for supporting something so silly?

If there is a good use case I could see it making sense to support it.

Short of a good use case we are talking about having to support weird
corner cases that no one really cares about that will just bit-rot.

Note.  You can identity map your original uid and gid, instead of
mapping your uid and gid 0.


We have occasionally talked about having a uid space that doesn't map to
the outside world.  Perhaps by having a 64bit kuid, while uid's remain
32bit.  I don't think anyone has pushed forward and merged that yet.  I
did see a proposal form "cells" the other day that appeared to have a
version of that idea implemented.  I mention it just in case that is
what you were expecting to exist in a fresh user namespace.
