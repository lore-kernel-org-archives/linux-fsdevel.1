Maybe I should shunt everything I write through an LLM so it catches
grammatical nonsense.

It was basically just trying to say "let's not redesign
current_chrooted()" in this series - which I already did above.

It would also be easy to prevent unprivileged chroot()ing into detached
mount trees. They're easy to recognize and it's not a super common
use-case.

Yeah, I'm not so excited about this part...

That sounds reasonable - the fchroot() extension is also a nice touch.
