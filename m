Hi everyone,

This *would have been* the eight public draft of the gigantic patchset
to connect the Linux fuse driver to fs-iomap for regular file IO
operations to and from files whose contents persist to locally attached
storage devices.

However, the previous submission was too large, and I didn't even send
half the patches!  I have therefore split the work into two sections.
This first section covers setting up fuse servers to run as contained
systemd services; I previously sent only the libfuse changes, without
any of the surrounding pieces.  Now I'm ready to send them all.

To summarize this patchbomb: fuse servers can now run as non-root users,
with no privilege, no access to the network or hardware, etc.  The only
connection to the outside is an ephemeral AF_UNIX socket.  The process
on the other end is a helper program that acquires resources and calls
fsmount().

Why would you want to do that?  Most filesystem drivers are seriously
vulnerable to metadata parsing attacks, as syzbot has shown repeatedly
over almost a decade of its existence.  Faulty code can lead to total
kernel compromise, and I think there's a very strong incentive to move
all that parsing out to userspace where we can containerize the fuse
server process.  Runtime filesystem metadata parsing is no longer a
privileged (== risky) operation.

The consequences of a crashed driver is a dead mount, instead of a
crashed or corrupt OS kernel.

Note that contained fuse filesystem servers are no faster than regular
fuse.  The redesign of the fuse IO path via iomap will be the subject of
the second patchbomb.  The containerization code only requires changes
to libfuse and is ready to go today.

Since the seventh submission, I have made the following changes:

1) Added a couple of simple fuse service drivers to the example code

2) Adapted fuservicemount to be runnable as a setuid program so that
unprivileged users can start up a containerized filesystem driver

3) Fixed some endianness handling errors in the socket protocol between
the new mount helper and the fuse server

4) Added a high level fuse_main function so that fuse servers that use
the high level api can containerize without a total rewrite

5) Adapted mount.fuse to call the new mount helper code so that mount -t
fuse.XXX can try to start up a contained server

6) Cleaned up a lot of cppcheck complaints and refactored a bunch of
repetitious code

7) Started using codex to try to find bugs and security problems with
the new mount helper

There are a few unanswered questions:

a. How to integrate with the SYNC_INIT patches that Bernd is working on
merging into libfuse

b. If /any/ of the new fsopen/fsconfig/fsmount/move_mount calls fail,
do we fall back to the old mount syscall?  Even after printing errors?

c. Are there any Linux systems where some inetd implementation can
actually handle AF_UNIX sockets?  Does it make sense to try to do the
service isolation without the convenience of systemd directives?

d. meson/autoconf/cmake are a pain to deal with, hopefully the changes I
made are correct

I have also converted a handful more fuse servers (fat, exfat, iso,
http) to the new service architecture so that I can run a (virtual)
Debian system with EFI completely off of containerized fuse servers.
These will be sent at the end.
