An 8-core machine with 16 threads can handle quite a bit of I/O, but
with the proposed scheme it will still have a single UNBOUND pool.
For NFS workloads I commonly benchmark, splitting the UNBOUND pool
on such systems is a very clear win.

This is exactly my concern. Smaller systems /do/ experience measurable
contention in this area. I don't object to your series at all, it's
clean and well-motivated; but the cores-per-shard approach doesn't scale
down to very commonly deployed machine sizes.

We might also argue that the NFS client and other subsystems that make
significant use of UNBOUND workqueues in their I/O paths might be well
advised to modify their approach. (net/sunrpc/sched.c, hint hint)

I claim that smaller deployments also need help. Further, I don't see
how UNBOUND pool fragmentation is a problem on such systems that needs
to be addressed (IMHO).
