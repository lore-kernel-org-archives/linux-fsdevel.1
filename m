I suppose you could prefork like that (with some difficulty) if you had
a means to convey the device, fstype, and mount options to each new
child as a mount request comes in.

Though if you had a way to do that, then you might be better off
shipping a canned kernel + hibernate image which would "unhibernate"
quickly, discover the fs parameters, and immediately engage the fuse
server.

<nod> But, uh, are those patches going to be reviewed?
