Makes sense.  I'll assume this can correspond to a reasonable workload.
It certainly seems like something that could exist.

Excellent!  Obviously it'd be even better if we didn't have to walk the
leading buffer_heads ... but there's no way to do this with the data
structure we have.

Yes, I think that's a good approach.

Ouch ;-)  No wonder you want to address this.  Do you recover all the
regression with this fix?

Is it that you're using some ext4 features that aren't supported by
iomap yet?  Could you say which ones?  That might motivate someone to
prioritise that support.

Absolutely.  Very happy with this approach.
