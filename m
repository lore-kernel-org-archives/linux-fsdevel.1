Tao,

This response is so full of misunderstandings it's not really worth me
responding to any of it. You've even hallucinated an imaginary field which
is REALLY suspicious.

You've no mm expertise or history and came up with this in a few hours. I
asked Claude to analyse it and it puts it at 75-80% chance of being solely
LLM-generated from cow_context.c.

I simply don't have the time to deal with this, so unfortunately I'm going
to have to withdraw the suggestion of further discussion with you on this
topic.

I am working on the scalable CoW project and will solicit opinions of those
with relevant expertise.

We are not interested in your approach or analysis.

Thanks, Lorenzo
