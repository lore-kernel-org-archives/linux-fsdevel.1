Yes.

The Posix definition of rename is very explicit that the old directory
entry shall be removed:

    Otherwise, if the directory entry named by new exists, it shall be
    removed and old renamed to new. In this case, a directory entry named
    new shall remain visible to other threads throughout the renaming
    operation and refer either to the file referred to by new or old
    before the operation began.

So the previous directory entry for "new" shall be removed.  If a
file system reuses the same d_off for the renamed file, it just created
a new entry that happens to instantly reuse the d_off in the same atomic
operation.

I would suggest to ignore posix_getdents or the whole Issue 8 base spec,
as unlike previous versions I did not try to document and norm existing
behavior, but instead comes up with it's own things.  If we need a
justification we should look at historic Linux and Unix behaviors and
older Posix specs that haven't drifted away from the purpose as much
as the current one.
