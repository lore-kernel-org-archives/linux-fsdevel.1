I see, I could understand why you wanted to change though. However, (in
my thought, this change has disadvantage by below reason) changing this
behavior because of layering violation is not good way, IMO.

I think it would happen with normal operation, for example, copy many
files more than total memory. I think this would be much common than
write=>close=>open=>fsync in your example.  Anyway, with it, reclaimed
inode metadata will be flushed forcibly and frequently (yeah, may not be
significant though. but I can't see the benefit for users from this
change.), and lost to chance combining multiple time of dirty while copy
many files.

Sounds great. How about we delay this behavior change until this
interface?

Thanks.
