It is certainly in part a matter of taste, so I certainly won't say this
is "wrong."

There is the matter of type safety, and the (possible) benefits this entails
such as automatic case coverage checking for switch-statements. However, I don't
doubt for a second you aren't aware of this, so that probably won't convince
you :) . We indeed also don't do this for flag-types, but at least that
is a kernel-wide established pattern (now I am curious how the Rust people
deal with flags).

What I find somewhat unfortunate is that if I am looking at
__filename_parentat(), for instance, the signature does not give me any
clue what the purpose is of int *type. Then I look through the code and see

		*type = nd.last_type;

and I have to jump to struct nameidata and it still tells me nothing. I have
to grep last_type in nameidata to see it is used in conjunction with the 
anonymous enum.

I can only tell that it would have slightly decreased cognitive load and jumping
around for me when I first looked into namei.c. How that compares to some churn I
can't say.

I agree with you and Amir. The naming is also a bit confusing. Maybe, I am
confusing myself but path_parentat() seems to return the parent component of the
pathname passed into nd, not the parent of the resolved path, and these do not
have to be the same if last_type isn't normal. I presume that is why they put
that check into vfs.c.

So what do you think is the best place to move 

 	if (unlikely(type != LAST_NORM)) {
 		path_put(path);
 		return -ENOENT;
 	}

to? path_parentat() or filename_parentat()?

And thanks a lot for taking the time to review, Al, I appreciate it :)

Thanks,
Jori.
