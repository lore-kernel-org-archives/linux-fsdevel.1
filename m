Ah one more thing!

What's next for this patch? Do we wait for BPF maintainers to comment?
Should I continue to add Reviewed-By trailers to the other patches?
(I have limited knowledge on some of the mutex stuff but the agent
review in b4 was helpful in understanding it enough to give a review.)

Sorry if it's obvious. I've never contributed to a patch this far
along or substantial to the point of having to understand the
merging/acceptance process in Linux.
