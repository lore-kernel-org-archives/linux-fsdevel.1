I ran some benchmarks on the split rstat trees idea. On an x86 80-cpu
2-node machine, it makes in-kernel flushing around 40% to 45% cheaper,
but for the userspace flushers, reading two rstat trees adds ~25%
overhead. I think this could be remedied though by just keeping the
existing tree as is for userspace flushers (eg hold all the stats, not
just the ones in-kernel flushers don't need) and adding a "slim" tree
with just the hot in-kernel stats for the in-kernel flushers. Reading
memory.stat would then just behave the same as it does now and the
in-kernel flushers would just walk the slim tree. This would add a bit
more overhead (and complexity) when updating hot stats though, but I
haven't yet benchmarked this "extra slim tree" idea nor pursued it
further. For the prefetching idea, when I ran some experiments with
prefetching the entire stats array on each CPU, I saw it made flushes
around 1% to 7% slower every time.

When I tried to measure the update cost of the split rstat trees (not
the slim tree variant), I was seeing a lot of inconsistent / noisy
numbers I couldn't get rid of even across boots of the same kernel and
even between memcgs on the same boot, which seemed weird. I ran perf
stat and that showed that the slow runs were executing the same number
of instructions but had a lot of extra stall cycles. The variation
between memcgs on the same boot pointed to maybe cacheline contention
being an issue and when I ran perf c2c, it showed that the most
contended cacheline between cpus was the first 64 bytes of
mem_cgroup_per_node, which is strange since those are only read on
stat updates and not written to.

That struct already has cacheline padding (_pad1_) to keep the memcg,
lruvec_stats_percpu, etc fields on a different cacheline from the
lruvec but apparently Intel/modern cpus do "spatial prefetching" that
pull in the adjacent cacheline (the Intel manual [1] says "This
prefetcher strives to complete every cache line fetched to the L2
cache with the pair line that completes it to a 128-byte aligned
chunk"). So I think basically every time we read lruvec_stats_percpu
(read on every per-node stat update), this pulls in the cacheline
holding the lru list heads. The lru list heads are constantly getting
written to by different cpus, so when the stat update happens and
pulls in that cacheline, that ends up introducing a lot of extra
overhead because it has to fetch that from another cpu, but also even
worse, whichever cpu holding lru_lock has to now invalidate that copy
before its next write and wait for all the acknowledgements to come
back, which adds extra latency to the lru critical section and
delays/hurts everyone who's waiting on the lru lock. I saw these same
results on the baseline kernel even without the split changes.

I think having the update path find the per-cpu counters through the
memcg instead of mem_cgroup_per_node fixes this. On a multi-threaded
fault benchmark in a single memcg, it improves shmem throughput by
~35% at 20 threads. I saw also that the inconsistent/noisy numbers I
was seeing across reboots / memcgs on the same boot disappeared too,
though I'm not sure yet why that fixed that issue. I'll clean up the
change in my tree and send that out as a patch.

But with that fix applied and with another series of local changes
that move LRU stat updates to outside the lru lock (I'll clean up and
send out this series as well, as it also applies to the base kernel
regardless of the split changes), I didn't see the split changes added
any update overhead that wasn't within noise. The lru stat updates
changes to move it outside the lru lock are necessary though, as
without that, there was around 2% increase in update overhead, since
it added more latency to the lru critical section. But after that was
moved out of the lru critical section, I didn't see any degradation
anymore.

My thinking was that on machines with hundreds of cpus, a good number
of them would likely have no memcg updates since the latest flush so
even the per-subsystem list would be empty a lot of the time. I can
try to find some data though on how often that actually happens in
prod.

I think maybe walking the per-subsystem list locklessly could be
slower in a lot of cases than just acquiring the lock? It seems like
we'd have to walk the whole list to know for certain if it's a
negative or not.

My plan is to clean up and send out the changes I have in my local
tree this next week (the cacheline fix, switching root readers to node
counters (getting rid of root flushes), updating stats outside the lru
lock, removing ratelimited variant of flushing (and then if needed,
more experimentation on the slim tree idea)).
