If you happened to know the sizes of the all the names in the directory,
you could make a sequence of getdents calls which each return precisely
1 entry,  You could then use lseek to determine the seek offset at every
point.
Linux getdents64 makes this a bit simpler by returning exactly that same
number (the seek offset to the next name) in the d_off field.

So posix certainly allows, indirectly, seeking to each d_off.

Posix refers to one directory entry "immediately following" another
which clearly implies a well defined sequence (if you exclude names
added and removed during the read).

Also glibc currently expects exactly this behaviour for implementing
telldir/seekdir.

I think a strong argument for Linux needing something is that NFS needs
working directory offsets to be able to support READDIR, because there
is no "OPEN" request for directories.

I agree it would be good to discuss this and hear other perspectives,
but I cannot see a lot of flexibility if we want a system that works
consistently.

Fixing tmpfs is easy.  I have a patch which makes it work much better
with less code.  Chuck quite reasonably wanted some objective measure of
"better" and suggested I write some test code for fstests.  Hence this
patch.

I know less about btrfs.  It appears to always add new names to the end
of the directory listing.  When you rename over an existing name, that
existing name is relocated to the end.  I can only guess why it might do
that.  I have no idea if it "needs" to do that.

Fun fact: This behaviour of btrfs (which I think is perfectly defensible
for new names) resulted in generic/736 (which I think is an unreasonable
test to impose) which btrfs "fixed" with a mechanism that doesn't work
over NFS.  i.e.  it doesn't work if you close and re-open the file for
each getdents call.
If I mount a btrfs filesystem over nfs with rsize=3D4096, then generic/736
fails.


The link you provided says:
  If a sequence of calls to posix_getdents() is made that reads from
  offset zero to end-of-file and a file is removed from or added to the
  directory between the first and last of those calls, whether the
  sequence of calls returns an entry for that file is unspecified.=20

which unfortunately doesn't cover what happens when a file is renamed.
When renamed to a non-existing name, it might be reasonable to describe
this as "removed from" and "added to" so its appearance could be
unspecified.
When renamed to an existing name, I don't think it reasonable to
describe the target name a being either "removed from" or "added to" the
directory.

Thanks for taking an interest,
NeilBrown
