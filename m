It could, but even scoping to user.* means adding conditional
xattr-copy logic into every filesystem's rename handler — with
dynamic allocation and xattr tree lookups on a hot path. ptime
avoids this: one inline inode field, clear semantics, same VFS
patterns as atime/mtime/btime.

You are right that copy tools require patches. If ptime only
improved the copy-tool situation, I would agree it does not
justify new kernel surface over xattrs.

The structural difference is in the default adoption path.
xattr preservation is permanently per-invocation opt-in: each
tool call needs the correct flag, and the default is to drop
them. A kernel timestamp exposed through statx/utimensat
follows the same API pattern as mtime — standard libraries
and tools naturally evolve to preserve all standard timestamps
by default. ptime has a path to default-preservation that
xattrs structurally cannot reach.

On the formats: the tar patch uses a vendor-prefixed PAX
header (SCHILY.ptime), backward-compatible — old readers
ignore it cleanly. The rsync patch plugs into the existing
--crtimes machinery that already supports macOS and Cygwin.

This is where the cover letter was not clear enough, and it
is the core reason ptime must be a kernel timestamp.

The patches implement rename-over preservation in all 5
filesystem rename handlers. When rename(source, target)
replaces an existing file, and the source has ptime=0 (the
default for any newly-created temp file) while the target
has ptime != 0, the filesystem copies the target's ptime to
the source before destroying the target's inode. This runs
inside the rename transaction, atomic with the rename itself.

Most GUI applications — LibreOffice, Kate, Qt and GNOME
apps — save via write-to-temp + rename-over-original. For
these, ptime survives automatically with no application
changes:

  1. App writes to temp file              (ptime = 0)
  2. rename(temp, document.odt)
  3. Kernel: source ptime=0, target!=0 -> copies ptime
  4. ptime preserved. No app change.

This is not universal: editors that use rename-away +
create-new (Vim with default backupcopy=no, Emacs) do not
trigger rename-over, and the spec documents this as a known
limitation. But the write-to-temp + rename-over pattern is
the dominant GUI save path, and the kernel handles it
transparently — something no xattr mechanism can provide
without application cooperation.

I think the use case is broader than I conveyed. Any workflow
that copies files from NTFS, APFS, or HFS+ onto native Linux
filesystems loses user-visible creation time unless carried
out-of-band. This affects personal migrations, enterprise
backups, dual-boot users, and professional workflows in
photography, legal, scientific data, and media production.
Windows, macOS, and SMB have supported a settable creation
timestamp for decades — Linux is the outlier.

Users already expend significant resources working around
this gap — metadata manifests, scripts to stamp creation
dates into filenames or xattrs, side-channel databases —
or simply accept the data loss. The cost is already being
paid, continuously and redundantly across the ecosystem.
One upstream investment in ptime converts that distributed
ongoing cost into a bounded effort.

ptime is separate from btime by design: it preserves btime's
value as immutable forensic metadata while providing a
settable timestamp that travels with file content across
filesystem boundaries.

On ecosystem cost: the kernel surface is ~240 lines across
28 files. For context, I am a disabled Medicaid recipient
who came to this from a disability rights litigation
workflow — I need file provenance preserved across an
NTFS-to-Btrfs migration for legal work. The complete
implementation — kernel patches across 5 filesystems,
tool patches, and xfstests — was produced in a few days using 
agentic development tools, which suggests the adoption cost may 
be meaningfully lower than traditional estimates as these 
tools become available across the ecosystem.

I understand a new timestamp is permanent API surface and
the bar should be high. My claim is that rename-over
preservation — automatic ptime survival through application
saves, without application changes — makes this materially
different from an xattr workaround, and justifies that cost.
