Hmm.  So the problem is that the user outside of the user namespace
can't write files unless he is mapped.

I think I even remember why that happened originally, it seems very
familiar.

I think that was to prevent processes running inside of a user namespace
from having to deal with files and directories appearing on their
filesystem that their isn't full information for because they aren't
mapped.

In particular I think it prevents "chmod u+S file" on a file that isn't
mapped into the user namespace.

The issue is that the mounter of the filesystem has all caps over the
filesystem.

So in general you don't want them to be able to manipulate files that
they couldn't create.
