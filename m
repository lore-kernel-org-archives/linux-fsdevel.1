I'm sorry but this is not how kernel development is done.

You're sending a series that's very invasive, that you've not coordinated
with anybody else, nor have you mentioned it at a conference, nor engaged
with in discussion with anybody else in the community in any way.

And you've sent it without an RFC, at -rc5 is... quite something.

We do NOT want to extend or expand or hack in anything like this on top of
the existing anon_vma machinery. It's a mess that requires replacement, not
more hacks or expansion.

I've been working on a replacement for the anonymous rmap, recently
presenting at LSF/MM, and all of that has been very public.

In fact I have engaged in recent work which reduced lock contention in
anon_vma, it's really quite discourteous for you not to have contacted me
or the community in addition to the above.

What are you talking about? 'Initialized'? They are created when memory is
faulted in, and we explicity need to know that that's the case.

Also the folio->mapping is required to point to something to allow for anon
rmap...

Right, because we never split or merge VMAs nor require anon rmap?

Well, it's needed the second something's faulted in so you can perform anon
rmap.

Err 'directly on VMA information'... a VMA pointer? That can change at any
point? What about remaps?...

I guess I'll see in the code.

Super invasive, extending the already broken abstraction further. We don't
want this.

This seems completely broken too re: anon_vma propagation on fork?

The above is only meaningful if you're not fundamentally breaking anon rmap
which is very easily done, but in addition, I'm not interested in seeing
the anon_vma machinery extended further.

This is what you should have sought AHEAD of sending this.

I'll look at the code, but in general you've gone about this in a really
unfortuate way with respect to the community. This is not to collaborate.
