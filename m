I already did, you've not responded to any of them, and I'm simply not
spending any more time on this.

The series is totally unmergeable, please do not make further rmap
submissions.

We're fine with using AI for language, or in general as long as there's a
clear understanding of what's being submitted.

However I'm very unconvinced that this series wasn't generated.

You have 2 patches in the kernel for the entirety of 2026. One in bluetooth
and one in the scheduler.

Prior to that you have patches from 2018 in device tree drivers.

You have exactly 0 contributions to mm.

Out of nowhere this year you have a big series for DMA, this series for
anon_vma, having done no work or any contributions to rmap, let alone one
of the trickiest and most complicated areas of mm.

You have a total of 39 mails on the linux-mm mailing list.

Suddenly doing a giant bit of work like this using code that looks entirely
like it's AI-generated, and which after assessment by AI gives an 85-90%
probability of AI generation is really suspicious.

Now, if I'm mistaken, and you have a different name/email/identity I missed
with many mm contributes - I will eat my words here (the series is still
unmergeable either way though).

So sorry, there's simply no trust and as a maintainer of rmap again I must
strongly suggest that you no longer submit patches for this part of the
kernel.

If you wish to build trust up again, begin with discussions, and maybe try
some smaller patches in mm to demonstrate that you're genuinely acting in
good faith?

Thanks, Lorenzo
