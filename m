No, you can't.  Despite the historic naming d_off is not an offset, but
a cookie.  You can not arithmetics on it.

Posix and Linux allow to seekdir to each cookie returned from telldir,
it does not allow to do arithmetics on it.

I think you're talking about posix_getdents here, which isn't really
Posix as we know it, but was added in the 2024 edition without actually
having relevant implementation so far.  It does however implement
the syscall-level API in most modern Unixes.  It does not mention
d_off at all, just the lseek-able file offset, though.

I don't think anyone disputes the need for stable directory offsets,
and we should (*knock on wood*) have implementation of native
file systems that fail this.

What the test tries to force is a specific behavior for rename onto
existing file names, replacing the original file name entry with
a new one of the same name.  The test expects that to reuse the
previous d_off, which is not required by any real or de facto standard.

btrfs doesn't manage freespace for the d_off space (doing so is quite
complicated and requires a lot of code in XFS for example), so it
simply uses a monotonically increasing counter for the value reported
in d_off.  This simplifies things a lot, and should work well on 64-bit
systems were you are basically impossible to round out of d_off values.
It might be a lot more problematic on 32-bit systems because the
seekdir/telldir cookie is a long and not a guaranteed 64-bit value.

That code and the tests looks a bit questionable, as readdir by
definition can't every complete in other file systems either if you add
new entries faster than the pace of readdir calls.  I.e. if you replace
the rename there with link calls adding new entries you run into the
same issue with every file system.

If we are talking about files, it is very clear that the target over
which is renamed is removed from the directory.  And if the source
was outside the directory it also is very clearly added.  The only
gray area is a source file that already was in the same directory.
