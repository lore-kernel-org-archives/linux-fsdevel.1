+=============================================
+STLMFS - Arm SCMI Telemetry Pseudo Filesystem
+=============================================
+
+.. contents::
+
+Overview
+========
+
+ARM SCMI is a System and Configuration Management protocol, based on a
+client-server model, that defines a number of messages that allows a
+client/agent like Linux to discover, configure and make use of services
+provided by the server/platform firmware.
+
+SCMI v4.0 introduced support for System Telemetry, through which an agent
+can dynamically enumerate configure and collect Telemetry Data Events (DE)
+exposed by the platform.
+
+This filesystem, in turn, exposes to userspace the set of discovered DEs
+allowing for their configuration and retrieval.
+
+Rationale
+=========
+
+**Why not using SysFS/KernFS or DebugFS ?**
+
+The provided userspace interface aims to satisfy 2 main concurrent
+requirements:
+
+ - expose an FS-based human-readable interface that can be used to
+   discover, configure and access Telemetry data directly from the
+   shell
+
+ - allow also alternative machine-friendly, more-performant, binary
+   interfaces that can be used by custom tools without the overhead of
+   multiple accesses through the VFS layers and the hassle of navigating
+   vast filesystem tree structures
+
+All of the above is meant to be available on production systems, not
+simply as a tool for development or testing, so debugFS is NOT an option
+here.
+
+An initial design based on SysFS and chardev/ioctl based interfaces was
+dropped in favour of this full-fledged filesystem implementation since:
+
+- SysFS is a standard way to expose device related properties using a few
+  common helpers built on kernfs; this means, though, that unfortunately in
+  our scenario we would have to generate a dummy simple device for each
+  discovered DE.
+  This by itself seems an abuse of the SysFS framework, but even ignoring
+  this, the sheer number of potentially discoverable DEs (in the order of
+  tens of thousands easily) would have led to the creation of a sensibly
+  vast number of dummy DE devices.
+
+- SysFS usage itself has its well-known constraints and best practices,
+  like the one-file/one-value rule, that hardly cope with SCMI Telemetry
+  needs.
+
+- The need to implement more complex file operations (ioctls/mmap) in
+  order to support the alternative binary interfaces does not fit with
+  SysFS/kernFS facilities.
+
+- Given the nature of the Telemetry protocol, the hybrid approach with
+  chardev/ioctl was itself problematic: on one side being upper-limited
+  in the number of chardev potentially created by the minor numbers
+  availability, on the other side the hassle of having to maintain a
+  completely different interface on the side of a FS based one.
+
+Design
+======
+
+STLMFS is a pseudo filesystem used to expose ARM SCMI Telemetry data
+discovered dynamically at run-time via SCMI.
+
+Inodes are all dynamically created at mount-time from a dedicated
+kmem_cache based on the gathered available SCMI Telemetry information.
+
+Since inodes represent the discovered Telemetry entities, which in turn are
+statically defined at the platform level and immutable throughout the same
+session (boot), allocated inodes are freed only at unmount-time and the
+user is not allowed to delete or create any kind of file within the STLMFS
+filesystem after mount has completed.
+
+A single instance of STLMFS is created at the filesystem level, using
+get_tree_single(), given that the same SCMI backend entities will be
+involved no matter how many times you mount it.
+
+Mountpoints
+===========
+
+A pre-defined mountpoint is available at::
+
+	/sys/fs/arm_telemetry/
+
+Usage
+=====
+
+.. Note::
+	See Documentation/ABI/testing/stlmfs for a detailed description of
+	this ABI.
+
+The filesystem can be typically mounted with::
+
+	mount -t stlmfs none /sys/fs/arm_telemetry
+
+It will proceed to create a top subdirectory for each of the discovered
+SCMI Telemetry instances named as 'tlm_<N>' under which it will create
+the following directory structure::
+
+	/sys/fs/arm_telemetry/tlm_0/
+	|-- all_des_enable
+	|-- all_des_tstamp_enable
+	|-- available_update_intervals_ms
+	|-- current_update_interval_ms
+	|-- de_implementation_version
+	|-- des/
+	|   |-- ...
+	|   |-- ...
+	|   `-- ...
+	|-- des_bulk_read
+	|-- des_single_sample_read
+	|-- groups
+	|   |-- ...
+	|   |-- ...
+	|   `-- ...
+	|-- intervals_discrete
+	|-- reset
+	|-- tlm_enable
+	`-- version
+
+Each subdirectory is defined as follows.
+
+des/
+----
+A subtree containing in turn one subdirectory for each discovered DE and
+named by Data Event ID in hexadecimal form as in::
+
+	|-- des
+	|   |-- 0x00000000
+	|   |-- 0x00000016
+	|   |-- 0x00001010
+	|   |-- 0x0000A000
+	|   |-- 0x0000A001
+	|   |-- 0x0000A002
+	|   |-- 0x0000A005
+	|   |-- ..........
+	|   |-- ..........
+	|   |-- 0x0000A007
+	|   |-- 0x0000A008
+	|   |-- 0x0000A00A
+	|   |-- 0x0000A00B
+	|   |-- 0x0000A00C
+	|   `-- 0x0000A010
+
+where each dedicated DE subdirectory in turn will contain files used to
+describe some DE characteristics, configure it, or read its current data
+value as in::
+
+	tlm_0/des/0xA001/
+	|-- compo_instance_id
+	|-- compo_type
+	|-- enable
+	|-- instance_id
+	|-- name
+	|-- persistent
+	|-- tstamp_enable
+	|-- tstamp_rate
+	|-- type
+	|-- unit
+	|-- unit_exp
+	`-- value
+
+groups/
+-------
+
+An optional subtree containing in turn one subdirectory for each discovered
+Group and named by Group ID as in::
+
+	|-- groups
+	|   |-- 0
+	|   |-- ..
+	|   `-- 1
+
+where each dedicated GROUP subdirectory in turn will contain files used to
+describe some Group characteristics, configure it, or read its current data
+values, as in::
+
+	scmi_tlm_0/groups/0/
+	|-- available_update_intervals_ms
+	|-- composing_des
+	|-- current_update_interval_ms
+	|-- des_bulk_read
+	|-- des_single_sample_read
+	|-- enable
+	|-- intervals_discrete
+	`-- tstamp_enable
