I agree. No arithmetic, but seek is allowed.
The cookies should all be unique across a single readdir pass, and none
of them may be zero as d_off is a seek address *after* the current name,
and the seek address zero is *before* all names.

The d_off provided by Linux is precisely a seek-address with a
granularity of one name, rather than a granularity of one getdents call.
This is implicit in the VFS implementation.

"should not" ??

That's debatable.  The documents that I have found don't mention rename.
Does that mean anything goes, or do that mean it doesn't get an
exemption from the general rule that all names must be listed?

I think that always allocating the next unused number when adding a name
to a directory is perfectly reasonable when 64bit seek addressing is
available.  The only question is on whether a replacing rename involves
"adding a name".

According to
  https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-btrfs/msg138653.html
this seem to come from
  https://github.com/landley/toybox/issues/306
which suggests that

  toybox find testdir -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -n1 sed -i s/a/b/=20

runs forever on btrfs.  Certainly this is unexpected behaviour.  Should
it be fixed in the filesystem or in toybox/find?

I can understand toybox wanting to be as simple as possible.  But
readdir() doesn't make any promises about terminating.

I wouldn't object to btrfs "fixing" this by never reporting new names
except that:
 1/ the interaction with rename/replace is problematic
 2/ the current fix doesn't work over NFS.

I think the rename issue can be fixed by simply reusing the existing
offset when reusing a name.  I might try a patch if a find some time.

I think a fix to make it work over NFS would be to report the entries in
reverse order - most recently added to least recently added.  This would
effectively encode the timestamp (last_index) in the seek cookie instead
of in btrfs_file_private.
Changing how the seek-cookie is interpreted could cause a hiccup
for an NFS client which was in the middle of a READDIR when a server
we reboot to a new verion of btrfs, but that is likely not significant.

Note that
  https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/functions/posix_getdents.h=
tml

uses the word "incremented" in=20

  the directory entry immediately following the last entry whose
  information was returned

but I don't think anyone seems interested in that detail.

As I explained in another email, I don't think it is reasonable to
interpret "files" as mentioned in the documentation as "inodes" but only
as "names".  I think the text is sloppy and should be more explicit but
if you uniformly assume "file" to mean "filesystem object" is doesn't
make sense.
