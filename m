Not from FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL, at least -- as far as I can see, none of
the filesystems implementing it updates the mtime, and even btrfs does
not do it from its label ioctl.  btrfs does have update_dev_time() for
the add/remove case (5a1972bd9fd4, so that libblkid does not keep
reading a stale cache), but that is not wired into its label ioctl.

I can see why.  What blkid keys on is the mtime of the /dev/xxx node,
and once the mount is set up we hold no reference to that path anymore
-- the node can be deleted or re-created, and s_id only keeps an
informational name.

Worse, one block device can have any number of /dev nodes pointing at
it; an ioctl on a mountpoint fd cannot tell which one the caller means,
nor find them all.  So the kernel has no well-defined node to update
here.

And it gets easy in userspace: for tools that take the device as an
argument (tune2fs, e2label, xfs_admin), one utime(device_name, NULL)
is enough to guarantee that after set the label of a device with
the tool, blkid -s <device> won't see the old label.

The tricky counterpart is the standard way to invoke this ioctl: a
mountpoint as the argument, xfs_io being the typical case.  It seems
the only option there is what the kernel would have to do anyway --
resolve the device behind the mount and update that node's mtime.

Do you have any thoughts?

Yep, that's the idea.  The point was to stay away from blkid's
cache complexity -- testing how a userspace tool caches things is
not really what a kernel test should be doing.
