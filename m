Indeed, it's very complex, but having the changes of 15 patches scattered across
various subsystems is really frustrating for reviewers. It took me a whole day to
read through the entire patch set, which made an already complicated matter even
more complex (maintaining such complex code in the future will be a pain).

However, overall, I think the original intention behind Tao's patch is innovative
and valuable, and Tao could definitely make this patch set simpler and more
readable, because the core changes actually start from PATCH 10.

I believe that if Tao had done the following, things might have gone better and easier
for reviewing. In fact, I understand the motivation behind the patch is quite simple
at its core (just wanting to avoid allocating the anon_vma structure when a VMA hasn't
been truly forked, and instead put the VMA information directly into folio->mapping):

1) You could actually simplify your patch significantly — without adding a lot of wrappers
and helper functions that introduce extra review overhead — and keep only the most essential elements.

2) Provide complete test code (in tools/testing/selftest) that covers the affected functionality,
such as VMA, huge pages, KSM, etc.

3) Use the RFC tag to start a discussion.


I would be very glad to see if Tao could post a simpler v2 version that does not alter the rmap
core data structures too much and does not introduce excessive complexity, no matter whether
it can be merged finaly.
