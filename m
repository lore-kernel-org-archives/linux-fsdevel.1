Thank you for your suggestion. Are you suggesting modifying the coredump
path to a location like /tmp and then copying the files from /tmp to the
final storage location? That would indeed be faster, but our tasks
sometimes consume a considerable amount of memory, and the dump time might
still be significant even when using a pipe. For our higher-level code,
even 100 ms might be a bit too long. Additionally, while directly calling
exit_files() in coredump_wait can cover most scenarios, if the
coredump_filter includes (bit 3) file-backed shared memory, it may not be
appropriate to release all files.

I actually prefer to dynamically create the bitmap for determining
close_before_core on demand. If the task hasn't set this attribute, then
we wouldn't create the bitmap, which would also save time on memory
allocation when this feature is not used.

This requirement can indeed be addressed with the MADV_DONTDUMP you
mentioned, thank you for your suggestion. But what troubles me is the
scenario mentioned above.

Thanks
