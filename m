I probably shouldn't reply to this email to waste more of your time, but I
can't help but respond because your comments have been very beneficial to
me, and I enjoy the process.

The v4 version has changed too much compared to the v3 version. I should
have re-executed the "get maintainer" script, but I mistakenly copied the
previous email list and sent it out. I sincerely apologize for that.

There are quite a few issues now, and I haven't come up with a good
overall solution. I actually want to resolve the problems we encountered
in our project with minimal kernel modifications, but I can't think of a
good way to do it. It seems that the v4 version has turned out to be a
complete disaster of a patch, and I sincerely hope that my example won't
be used as a counterexample in the future. Thank you for that.

Suddenly, I have some thoughts about this issue, but I even question
whether I should have these ideas. Let me sit down and sort things out
properly. I hope the v5 version won't be a disaster.

Thanks
Xin Zhao
