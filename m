I had considered that but introducing this change alongside this series
felt too spicy for me.

I think I generally agree with you. My main concern here is mostly about
changing very long-standing behavior here and making failfs special here
feels like it could easily misused.

If we could altering this definition from the patchset I would be in
favor of it. I'm curious what your take is though.
