Background:
During the 2024 discussion on additional statx() attributes, the introducti=
on of a generic STATX_ATTR_OFFLINE attribute was proposed and discussed as =
a potentially useful cross-filesystem property. The discussion highlighted =
use cases in HSM systems, network filesystems, and userspace tools that nee=
d to distinguish fully available files from files whose content is not imme=
diately accessible.

Since then, Linux has gained support for pre-content access notifications t=
hrough FAN_PRE_ACCESS, which provides a mechanism for userspace to supply f=
ile data before read access proceeds. This addresses a significant part of =
the data access path for content that is not immediately available locally.

However, userspace still lacks a standardized way to determine whether a fi=
le's contents are currently available without triggering access.

This RFC revisits the earlier discussion and proposes a minimal and filesys=
tem-agnostic solution.

Problem Statement:
Today, userspace applications can determine many file properties through st=
atx(), but there is no generic mechanism to discover whether file content i=
s immediately available.

As a result:
General-purpose tools cannot distinguish between available and unavailable =
file content.
Filesystems may implement similar semantics differently.
Userspace software lacks a common API for querying content availability.
The recently introduced pre-content access infrastructure can hydrate conte=
nt when accessed, but applications cannot discover the state beforehand.
Proposal

Introduce a new statx() attribute:
STATX_ATTR_OFFLINE

Semantic definition
A file marked with STATX_ATTR_OFFLINE satisfies the following condition:

The file's metadata is available, but the file's content is not currently g=
uaranteed to be immediately accessible without additional retrieval, restor=
ation, hydration, or staging work.

This definition intentionally avoids any assumptions regarding:
- storage technology
- retrieval mechanism
- userspace implementation
- caching policy
- filesystem type

The attribute describes the current availability of file content and nothin=
g more.

Intended Usage:
Examples of applications that may benefit from a standardized OFFLINE attri=
bute include:

- search tools
- backup software
- indexing services
- archiving software
- HSM implementations
- filesystem management utilities

Example:
statx file.dat

could return:
Attributes OFFLINE

allowing userspace applications to make informed decisions before opening t=
he file.

Non-Goals:
This proposal does not attempt to standardize:
- synchronization status
- upload status
- conflict states
- caching policies
- retention policies
- provider-specific metadata
- graphical user interface behavior

In particular, this RFC intentionally does not propose attributes such as:
- PINNED
- SYNC_PENDING
- ERROR

as these describe userspace policy decisions rather than generic filesystem=
 content availability.

The proposed attribute only answers one question:

Is the file content currently offline?

Filesystem Support

Filesystems may expose STATX_ATTR_OFFLINE if they can reliably determine th=
at file data is not immediately available.

Implementation details remain filesystem specific.

A filesystem may map the attribute to:

- persistent inode flags
- internal metadata
- remote state information
- HSM state information

The RFC intentionally does not mandate how the state is stored.

Relationship to Existing Work

This proposal is intended as a direct continuation of the 2024 STATX_ATTR_O=
FFLINE discussion and follows the same general direction suggested there. T=
he goal is not to introduce a new subsystem but to define a common userspac=
e-visible semantic that can be implemented across filesystems and consumed =
by generic tools.

The proposal is complementary to the recently introduced pre-content access=
 infrastructure (FAN_PRE_ACCESS). While FAN_PRE_ACCESS addresses content re=
trieval before access, STATX_ATTR_OFFLINE provides a mechanism for userspac=
e to determine content availability before attempting access.

Request for Feedback

Is the proposed semantic definition sufficiently generic?

This RFC intentionally focuses on a single, narrowly scoped semantic proper=
ty in order to maximize reuse across filesystems and userspace tools while =
minimizing policy decisions in the kernel.
