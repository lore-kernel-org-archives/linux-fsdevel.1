I understand your approach, as discussed it's not viable.

As mentioned elsewhere, please refrain from further code contributions to
rmap, as there is now a trust issue due to a high likelihood of undeclared
AI-generated code.

You are, however, welcome to engage in discussion, and I'm happy to discuss
the approach publicly on list or via private email whichever you prefer :)

You are also welcome to engage in discussion/review/critique once I produce
my RFC for this.

Thanks, Lorenzo
