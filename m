I think I like this, but some comments:

It's perfectly valid to cd to a directory that does not belong to
one's namespace.  We have fchdir.  What's wrong with letting it
continue working?

Regardless of that, the current directory either needs to be a
directory or to be nothing at all, and if we support the latter, we
need to figure out what /proc will show.

> #### Null user namespace

A user namespace is kind of about how *non-current* uids and gids work
for the process and how it perceives its own uid and gid and not so
much about what uid and gid it has when accessing outside resources.
So...

What does that mean?  What does ps show?



Maybe the way to go is to implement the ones that have clearer
semantics and to defer the others.
