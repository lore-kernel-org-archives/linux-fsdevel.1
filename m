Indeed, I originally built and installed it manually in an
environment without libblkid-dev.

Hmm, what I disabled is exactly the set duplicated by util-linux:
the blkid/uuid libs and UUID/LABEL= handling all live there, so
the tools just link the system ones -- there is no functional loss.

That sounds much better than a hand install -- I'll give it a try.

Yes -- we need to add a utime() in tune2fs's ioctl path to update
the device mtime; I'll send a patch shortly.

For the kernel side, we don't have the dev path that the caller
is using, so it is not doable there: the inode we can reach
inside the ioctl is not the one userspace sees.  Details are in my
reply to Darrick:

https://lore.kernel.org/all/eeeab8d8-dfd3-45ff-9f30-d83c527210f2@linux.alibaba.com

Also, a thought that just came up: on the blkid side, would it be
feasible to not trust the cache for mounted devices and always
re-probe?  The mount / set label / umount / get label (within 2s)
window would remain, but it would be much smaller.


Thanks,
Baokun
