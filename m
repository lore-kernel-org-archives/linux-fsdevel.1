Not sure if you're asking Tao or me about a blog post here? :)

I think there's broad awareness (from myself in particular...!) of this.

I understand and empathise with language difficulties - I have zero
objection to using LLMs to assist with that.

But none of my objections relate to this.

We have received a huge, invasive, unmergeable series with code that reads
exactly as you'd expect from LLM-generated code, that Claude assigns a high
probability of being AI generated, from somebody with:

- 0 previous mm contributions
- 0 interactions in rmap
- 2 patches in 2026 (neither mm)
- prior to that only devicetree contributions from 8 years ago

What would you have me do under those circumstances?

Unfortunately this means I have very little trust in Tao, and given limited
maintainership resource, as I said, I suggest he attempts no further code
contributions to rmap.

And as I said elsewhere, he can rebuild trust through constructive
discussion. Also perhaps building up credibility in mm through smaller
series showing understanding?

Thanks, Lorenzo
