For Lustre fscrypt we just *always* use 4096-byte fscrypt blocks.

That ensures that x86 and aarch64-64k (or other) clients can read
and write fscrypt files in a compatible manner.  I don't _think_
there is any performance advantage to be had from doing fscrypt in
64k chunks, and this would also keep the ext4 filesystem compatible
between aarch64-64k and x86 clients in the (less common) case it is
mounted on a different host.

Cheers, Andreas
