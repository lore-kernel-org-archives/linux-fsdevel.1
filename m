Hi,
While running experiments, I came across an interesting finding.

Context:
When writing data beyond the available space/quota on the server, we
don't expect to receive an error on write immediately, given its a
buffered write. The EDQUOT/ENOSPC error surfaces on a call to fsync(2),
either directly, or implicitly via close(2). CAVEAT: close(2), doesn't
guarantee a flush of data to the backing store.

Finding:
When the flush of over-flowed data - sitting in the pagecache is tried
using a fsync(2) call, we expect it to fail. However, it looks like that
the NetFS layer, used by the SMB client to do the writeback, doesn't
re-set the dirty bit on the pages/folios on which fsync fails. At this
point the pages with critical user-data are sitting in the pagecache,
but no longer marked dirty/referenced by the inode of the file. This
behavior is seen for EDQUOT/ENOSPC errors, contrary to EIO errors where
data is re-dirtied. It seems that EDQUOT/ENOSPC are treated as
non-retriable errors, as a reason the dirty bit is not re-set.
I noticed that NFS also has a similar behavior where the pages are not
dirty after the failed fsync. Naturally, now that the fsync is
tried before calling close, and with the data not-dirty anymore, no
errors are seen on close.

While, the close(2) manpage explicitly states that upon failure, close
should not be retired, I do believe that the data should still remain
dirty. An application (should) calling fsync before close would monitor
for errors, and should be able to retry the fsync after increasing the
capacity on the server.

I would appreciate thoughts on my idea.=20
