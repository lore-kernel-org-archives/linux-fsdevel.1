No one is disagreeing with you Christoph.

What I was saying is that giving support for an unlimited number of
collisions would require an update to the on-disk format, which is a
lot of work as it implies metadata changes, feature incompatibility
bits, updating the user space tools, etc.
Given the work that would be needed and the fact no users have
complained about this (to my knowledge at least), the motivation for
such big changes isn't much.

Because no one reported -EOVERFLOW errors when creating files. I
haven't seen it in more than 12 years at least - sure it doesn't mean
there isn't someone who hasn't hit it, but we don't know about it.

What this test is doing is to verify we don't turn the fs into RO mode
after -EOVERFLOW - which is actually a regression we had since 2022,
and could be used as a sort of denial of service.
This is a useful test for us btrfs developers to make sure we don't
regress on that.

You may disagree with not allowing an unlimited number of hash
collisions, but that is another topic and doesn't invalidate this test
(and that's part of the reason why it's a btrfs specific test).
