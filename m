Ok, so I was looking into things and as usual got
side-tracked so here we are. Oleg, save me please.

IF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL is used to kick a task in uninterruptible sleep to
return to userspace and run task work and then go back to sleep. This
mechanism works well but breaks coredumps. dump_interrupted() only
allows fatal signals to interrupt a coredump and the whole regular write
path going to actual filesystems is impervious to TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL as
well.

The core is that you can have quite deep callchains that end up calling
signal_pending() in both the pipe and the socket codepaths so it's like
we can just pass a flag through somehow.

For coredumps its very annoying because it means io_uring is - depending
on how much outstanding work you have - incompatible with generating
non-truncated coredumps. A process with too many file backed mappings
and io_uring requests in flight ends up losing most of the coredump.

While zap_threads() has cleared TIF_SIGPENDING for a long time, just
clearing TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL isn't going to work because the next
completion will just set it again.

The fun part also is that io_uring isn't actually the only case:

(1) io_uring

(2) klp_send_signals()

(3) bpf_task_work_schedule_signal()

(4) landlock's tsync

And technically, kthread_stop() and the printk kunit test set the bit
raw. So no simple way of just fixing this in one subsystem.

So, a fix for this issue has the following constraints:

(i) The places where a write is aborted are deep callchains that we
    can't reasonably parameterize. For example, anon_pipe_write(),
    unix_stream_sendmsg(), unix_stream_read_generic(),
    sk_stream_wait_memory(), or a bare wait_event_interruptible() in
    wait_for_dump_helpers(). All of them are shared with regular
    syscalls that must stay interruptible.

    IOW, the state has to be per-task and ambient.

    An LLM would call this "load bearing"...

(ii) There are multiple ways TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL can get raised and they
     can get set from irq context against any task. As said above we
     have at least io_uring paths (poll task_work, msg_ring, tctx exit,
     io-wq via __set_notify_signal()), bpf_task_work_schedule_signal(),
     klp_send_signals(), landlock tsync, plus kthread_stop() and the
     printk kunit stuff that set the bit raw.

     So fixing this up in the individual subsystems is doomed to fail or
     require constant audits in case some new variant shows up.

(iii) The coredump task is exiting and can't restart the work.

So here's some stuff that was considered but I think it not really
feasible:

(a) Check for task_is_coredumping(). That will end up forcing
    task_work_add() users to know about coredumps. This seems like a
    layering violation.

    I have a patch for this as well but it's ugly. It races with the
    dump staarting unless the bit setter takes a lock in the io_uring
    completion. I know someone that will disagree with this approach. ;)

(b) Oleg's old suggestion iirc. Just clear the bit at coredump entry.
    That doesn't work because io_uring poll completions just raise it
    again from irq context. So you also need synchronization with the
    setter of which there are quite a few.

(c) Let the setting task defer setting the bit if the task is flagged
    and then raise it again at exit.

(d) Take TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL out of singal_pending() and make it opt-in at
    specific points. That breaks io_uring quite badly and forces a
    tree-wide audit.

So the amount of patches for this issue over the years is impressive. So
let me add one to the pile for the lolz.

Add PF_NO_NOTIFY_SIGNAL and helpers to raise/restore it. This is the
same approach as memalloc_nofs_save(). signal_pending() will not report
a fake pending signal via TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL if inside a
PF_NO_NOTIFY_SIGNAL critical section. Obviously you can't
fork()/clone3() in such a section.

Fix coredumps and smb. Fwiw, I think there's a few other potential users
of the helpers that are left out of this series.
