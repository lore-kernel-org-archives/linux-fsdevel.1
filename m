I am replying to both Andy and David in a single email --- hope that is
not confusing.

Ah! This is the first I am learning about the new nullfs. OK yes I agree
this gives us both properties, since it is truly immutably empty.

I still have a slight preference for something that also makes
statting/opening/etc. of `/` itself fail, but this is otherwise good ---
there's no denying it.

I really like these ideas!

- Splitting the two uses of root sounds great. Even more generally (at
  least as a thought experiment, I don't like the O(n) performance), one
  can imagine a set of paths one must not `cd ..` past. Conceptually, I
  feel optimistic that inserting another boundary path into the set on
  every `chroot` makes it safe.

- In the original "real root", the "root for .." field could be null,
  since no `..` check is actually needed. Then, if we only want to have
  a single "root for .." (to avoid the O(n)), only the initial
  assignment of it from null to non-null would be unprivileged --- this
  would implement your "task is not already chrooted" idea. Subsequent
  assignment would still be privileged since we are replacing, not
  extending our "set". (The nullable single path means we have 0 or 1
  paths in our set.)

I did get the impression that the `..` check is...rather fragile. I am
also thinking that a global setting like `openat2`'s `RESOLVE_BENEATH`
to make `..` never work would be useful; then all manner of chrooting is
trivially safe, because you cannot go up regardless!

Given the state of the discussion, I'll go submit my null cwd and root
patch momentarily. The nullfs alternative is quite compelling; to the
extent that I do prefer making the root operations fail as I said above,
I think my best shot is demonstrating that this patch is so small and
lightweight that this slight benefit is paid for by the simplicity of
the implementation.

John
