"Standard"... I was about to write a sardonic reply here, but then I
remembred that Linux finally *does* have a standard means to transfer
some of those newer file attributes: file_getattr/file_setattr.

(Go Andrey!)

So, I guess all you really need to do is extend struct file_attr and now
userspace has a fairly convenient means to propagate the provenance
time. :)

So does the provenance time cover just the file's contents, or the other
attributes and xattrs?

The reason I ask is, does the ptime get copied over for an FICLONE,
which maps all of one file's data blocks into another?

And by extension, would it also need to be exchanged if you told
XFS_IOC_EXCHANGE_RANGE to exchange all contents between two files?

(I know, I know, you said XFS was TBDHBD ;))

Last question: Is the provenance time only useful if the file is
immutable?  Either directly via chattr +i, or by enabling fsverity?
