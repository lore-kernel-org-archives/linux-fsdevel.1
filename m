Thank you for your suggestion. Now, besides knowing about MADV_DONTDUMP to
filter out uninteresting memory, I also learned about the new method you
mentioned: the coredump socket protocol.

In addition to the need to filter out uninteresting memory during a core
dump, what I really hope to address is the issue of the flock lock being
held for a long time during the core dump process. I have completely
given up on adding a new fcntl interface to solve this problem. In the v2
version I sent, I called exit_files in coredump_wait to address this
issue. Please let me know if you have any comments on my v2 version.
