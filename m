Partly yes. This path has nothing to do with IMMUTABLE bit, since I used to
activate the large folio with that bit, but hit a big pain which requires
clearing the bit whenever just deleting the file.

So, this gives a new way to activate the large folio by chmod(0400) and
setxattr("user.fadvise") only while providing quick inode eviction in order
to set mapping by iget, and allowing file deletion easily.

I feel the arguable points would be 1) the path to evict inode by calling
d_drop in release_file and returning 1 in drop_inode, 2) how to give the
hint between fadvise(FADV_LARGE_FOLIO) or setxattr(user.fadvise) by individual
file system.

Thank you for taking the time to take a look.
