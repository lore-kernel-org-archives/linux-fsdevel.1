Yeah, clang's -Wuninitialized and -Wsometimes-uninitialized are on by
default (not just at W=1) for the kernel, whereas GCC's
-Wmaybe-uninitialized has been under W=2 since 78a5255ffb6a ("Stop the
ad-hoc games with -Wno-maybe-initialized") back in 5.7.

I consider this an unfortunate difference between GCC and clang with
regards to -Wuninitialized. If there is any control flow that would
avoid the block that uses the variable uninitialized, GCC "downgrades"
it to -Wmaybe-uninitialized, whereas clang keeps it as -Wuninitialized
with a note of "when used here" to make it clear that the variable will
be used uninitialized if the block is reached:

It would be nice for my sanity if it could be but then we are back into
the same situation of false positives, as GCC's warnings are influenced
by optimizations, whereas clang's warnings happen purely in the frontend
before optimizations happen. clang's versions do not flag as many
instances of potentially uninitialized variables (as it cannot do
interprocedural analysis to see across function boundaries) but that
results in much fewer false positives in my experience.

Bummer :/

Thanks, I will give it a build test but it seems obvious that it will
fix it.
