Yes, this use case is quite rare.

I am also concerned that synchronous write-back might introduce
performance regressions. Although the probability is relatively low
(I'm not sure), perhaps some users who use post-EOF writing will
complain.

In this corner case, ext4+iomap also encountered the same dilemma, as it
can no longer use data=ordered to achieve asynchronous persistence.

FYI, the current approach of ext4+iomap is to submit an I/O immediately
after zeroing the EOF block, but it does not wait for the I/O to
complete. In the subsequent endio process, it waits for this zero I/O to
complete before updating i_disksize beyond the end of the gap.

Best Regards,
Yi
