I have some local demo patches doing something similar, and I think this
work could be decoupled from Yi's patch set.

Since inode preallocation (PA) maintains physical block occupancy with a
logical-to-physical mapping, and ensures on-disk data consistency after
power failure, it is an excellent location for recording temporary
occupancy. Furthermore, since inode PA often allocates more blocks than
requested, it can also help reduce file fragmentation.

The specific approach is as follows:

1. Allocate only the PA during block allocation without inserting it into
   the extent status tree. Return the PA to the caller and increment its
   refcount to prevent it from being discarded.

2. Issue IOs to the blocks within the inode PA. If IO fails, release the
   refcount and return -EIO. If successful, proceed to the next step.

3. Start a handle upon successful IO completion to convert the inode PA to
   extents. Release the refcount and update the extent tree.

4. If a corresponding extent already exists, we’ll need to punch holes to
   release the old extent before inserting the new one.

This ensures data atomicity, while jbd2—being a COW-like implementation
itself—ensures metadata atomicity. By leveraging this "delay map"
mechanism, we can achieve several benefits:

 * Lightweight, high-performance COW.
 * High-performance software atomic writes (hardware-independent).
 * Replacing dio_readnolock, which might otherwise read unexpected zeros.
 * Replacing ordered data and data journal modes.
 * Reduced handle hold time, as it's only held during extent tree updates.
 * Paving the way for snapshot support.

Of course, COW itself can lead to severe file fragmentation, especially
in small-scale overwrite scenarios.

Perhaps I’ve overlooked something. What are your thoughts?

Baokun
