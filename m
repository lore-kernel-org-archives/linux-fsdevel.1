I am not sure whether you shared whatever concerns you are talking about.  =
If
they are valid, we would be happy to engage and resolve them.

I am aware of the past discussions, but we did spend additional effort to f=
ind a
way that worked well for everyone in the end.

I think it takes two hands to clap.

So far, I have tried to engage constructively, and offered to discuss where
these kfuncs collectively should stay in a separate discussion. Explained w=
hy it
cannot be done unilaterally, and that we need consensus from all stakeholde=
rs
(FS, BPF, LSM). Explained that we need to figure out how the testing strate=
gy
for such cross-cutting changes would work if they don't go through BPF tree=
.

In response, I have only seen you continually tried to derail the whole thi=
ng
over the location of the kfunc, threatening to not let it move forward.

Yes, I understand you feel it should be placed under security/. You are ent=
itled
to your opinion.

No, I do not think the newly added kfunc is a big enough layering violation=
 such
that we need to do it ASAP, disregarding everything else outlined above. I =
am
sure you see that too. There are several other instances of similar kfuncs.

Therefore, please attempt to meet me halfway here.

It is calling a single security_lsmxattr_add() kfunc cleanly abstracted and
already placed under security/, where it belongs.

It doesn't scale. The amount of combinations (architectures x compilers x m=
odes)
that need to be tested for the BPF subsystem is beyond reasonable for any p=
atch
submitter to test themselves. The only realistic approach is letting it go
through BPF CI and exercising the full matrix on submission.

It is fairly apparent to me that you do not have a clear picture how BPF co=
de
gets tested (which is fine and understandable).

It only underscores my point: we need to move this discussion elsewhere, an=
d
have a broader dialogue and form consensus. Not litigate over it in this th=
read.

David spent considerable effort on this set, and has carefully reworked his=
 code
several times. Blocking his work over this terriotrial argument would be a =
loss
for everyone, including the users of the kernel.

Anyhow, I cannot stop you, but it would be unfortunate if you continue to d=
ouble
down, in that case we'll have to figure out other ways of moving things for=
ward.
