Aha, that function got left out of the stub. :(

Annoyingly, on Linux the build succeeds despite the missing symbol
when I tweak meson so that it doesn't build the service stuff.  I would
have thought that --no-undefined would have done that, but alas.

Sorry about that too.  The following patch fixes it.

Not sure why checkpatch fails, this is what I got (Debian 13):

Your patch has no obvious style problems and is ready for submission.

cppcheck had a few things to say, but none of it was about the changed
lines.

Hrmm.  I guess I'll have to figure out how to get those things running.
That said, the stuff in mount_service.c is internal to libfuse (i.e.
it's not public library API) so I didn't comment them as intensely.
Would you like more?

Yay!

               ^ is there an "I" here?  e.g. "...if I skip posting..."?

/My/ normal practice (from xfs) was to repost the series as it was
merged, followed by an announcement.  That way the mailing list is a
complete record of what was merged.  However, very very few people
actually do that, even in the kernel.

I'm ok with you not posting another version of the series.

Nah, just merge it.  I'll look over the changes once it's in the branch
and if there's anything weird, you or I or anyone else can send patches.
As long as you're not planning to tag it as a release, nothing's set in
stone.

<nod> Let me know what you want changed, I'll be around since I am not
travelling anywhere for a couple of weeks. :)

I can reflow changes into the patchset, or if you'd prefer, I can add
them as new patches that would go on the end of the series.
