Userspace can already mix the modes on the same file today, by
opening it twice, once with and once without O_DIRECT, or even on a
single struct file with fcntl(F_SETFL, O_DIRECT). The patch requires
FMODE_CAN_ODIRECT in kiocb_set_rw_flags(), the same check open() and
fcntl() do for O_DIRECT, so it doesn't allow direct I/O on files
that couldn't do it before.

The use case is Samba: SMB3 clients request unbuffered I/O per
request (SMB2_READFLAG_READ_UNBUFFERED and
SMB2_WRITEFLAG_WRITE_UNBUFFERED). Samba wants to use a strategy
similar to NFSD_IO_DIRECT in nfsd: for reads the range is aligned
down and up to the STATX_DIOALIGN values and read with RWF_DIRECT,
for writes the aligned middle is written with RWF_DIRECT and the
unaligned head and tail (if any) with RWF_DONTCACHE (or plain
buffered I/O if the file system doesn't support it). Without
RWF_DIRECT Samba would have to keep a second O_DIRECT file
descriptor for every open, which only hides the mixing from the
kernel.

Right, that's the real difference: with two opens or F_SETFL the
O_DIRECT in file->f_flags always matches IOCB_DIRECT, with RWF_DIRECT
it doesn't, and FMODE_CAN_ODIRECT alone doesn't tell whether a file
system copes with that. For some file systems FMODE_CAN_ODIRECT is
still only derived from ->direct_IO = noop_direct_IO in
do_dentry_open(), so it just means that O_DIRECT can be opened.
cifs.ko is an example: with cache=loose cifs_file_write_iter()
decides by O_DIRECT, so an RWF_DIRECT write would be written
unbuffered by netfs, but without the cache invalidation and oplock
reset cifs does for O_DIRECT.

So what about making it opt-in as a start, like RWF_DONTCACHE with
FOP_DONTCACHE? A new FOP_DIRECT_PER_IO would be set by file systems
that base their I/O decisions on IOCB_DIRECT, all others return
-EOPNOTSUPP for RWF_DIRECT. Once all file systems that set
FMODE_CAN_ODIRECT also set FOP_DIRECT_PER_IO, the flag could be
removed again and RWF_DIRECT would just depend on FMODE_CAN_ODIRECT.

I looked at the local file systems Samba typically exports in
v7.4-rc1: xfs, ext4, btrfs and f2fs (and also ext2, exfat, gfs2,
nilfs2, zonefs, ntfs and ceph) decide per I/O based on
iocb->ki_flags & IOCB_DIRECT, falling back to buffered I/O per
request where direct I/O isn't possible (e.g. ext4 for encrypted,
verity or inline data files, nilfs2 for writes) or failing it with
-EOPNOTSUPP (f2fs for atomic write files, ntfs for compressed or
encrypted files). O_DIRECT in file->f_flags is only used for
checks at open time (or the start of an f2fs atomic write), so they
could set FOP_DIRECT_PER_IO right away.

Others like cifs, nfs, 9p, overlayfs and the other backing file
users, ntfs3, erofs, ocfs2 and fuse have O_DIRECT dependencies in
their open or I/O paths, they just wouldn't set FOP_DIRECT_PER_IO
for now. Fixing them is independent of RWF_DIRECT.

Should I send a v2 that adds FOP_DIRECT_PER_IO and sets it for the
file systems listed above?
