dm-verity reads opaque sectors whereas this runs
superblock/extent/directory parsers running on attacker-writable data.

The mitigation mentioned below kinda defeats the feature... The
filesystem that contains the image files is writable and the whole
rootimagesrcdir= exists to keep it reachable. If you could dm-verity is
as stated below, you would just dm-verity the root and used
dm-mod.create=

All of the other issues:

* init suddenly becomes deployment policy
* things shipped as modules
* composefs can't use this
* the alternative to achieve the same thing via CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE
  / UKI signed initrd completely ignored

/me walks away from this LLM hell.
