Doing this is almost trivial. The problem really is that we'd expose
"procfs2" or whatever as a new mount option to userspace without
actually having fundamentally revamped what we would like procfs2 to do.
IOW, it would elevate a security hack that got added a while ago to a
new filesystem type. I think that would just be sad. So I'm not so
excited about doing this.

I somewhat disagree because it's unclear where you draw the line. If you
use the hidepid= stuff at its most restrictive where it only shows tasks
your user owns you could also argue that it's very close to a separate
filesystem type. It's strictly subtractive and so is pidonly. There's
just nothing that's better or novel.

It's not a problem today. I think we can simply treat
SB_I_RESTRICTED_VARIANT as not allowing other restricted variants. And
we'd need a more elaborate mechanism anyway once we'd have "compatible"
subsets.

So I think yes, SB_I_RESTRICTED_VARIANT is fine by me for now.
