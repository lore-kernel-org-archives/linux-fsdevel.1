I think that about covers it!

I do agree wrt to the iomap_iter thing in that it doesn't seem like the
most elegant thing. I considered that a bit of a roadblock when first
hacking on the batch stuff, but IIRC somebody pointed out that there was
precedent already so I didn't think too hard about it after that. Indeed
if you poke around, other filesystems use a similar pattern to access
iter->private for whatever private context is carried around.

FWIW, one of the longer term thoughts for the dirty folio stuff was to
eventually lift it out of the callback and just have iomap do it for the
fs. That would eliminate this particular pattern and probably clean
things up a bit, but there were also some other caveats with that that
aren't top of mind atm (IIRC, things like dealing with map trimming,
etc., but I haven't had a chance to think about it in a while).

Also note that this isn't necessarily a hard requirement. It's an
optional optimization. iomap will flush and retry in the dirty
pagecache+unwritten extent case if the fs hasn't otherwised provided
folios to make sure it zeroes properly, it's just that performance of
that may or may not be acceptable for your use case.
